<p>
"Producer, Writer, Composer, Philanthropist"
<br/><br/>
Wyclef Jean “Clef” is a music producer, songwriter and philanthropist. When seeing Clef in his 
element, on stage; so completely comfortable, it’s easy to see him only as a performer. A short dive 
into his history reveals we are only witnessing the tip of the iceberg. The flashpoint of his career 
ignited when Clef teamed with Pras Michel and Lauryn Hill to join the band that would go on to 
become the record­breaking group, The Fugees. Their sophomore album The Score got two 
Grammys, sold 15 million copies and was listed in Rolling Stones Magazine’s list of the 500 greatest 
albums of all times.
His solo project The Carnival dropped and spun to Platinum certification and earned three more 
Grammy nominations. In addition to his solo work, Clef emerged as prolific producer, developing 
breakout single “No No No” for Destiny’s Child and the platinum single “My Love Is Your Love” for 
Whitney Houston. Over the next decade, Whyclef hit the Grammy’s three more times, receiving 
nominations for his collaborations Mary J. Blige, Jerry Duplessis and Shakira. Clef’s work around the 
world and his broad musical background have put him at the forefront of world music.
Clef is currently working on his seventh studio album with Tim Berg “AVICII”, so get ready to hear the 
Wyclef’s “Ecleftic” style drop again later this year.

<h3 style="margin: 30px 0;">Elias</h3>
<p>
Stockholm based Elias is a young talent with a huge voice. His debut single “Revolution” impressed and 
engaged listeners from all over the world this spring giving him the opportunity to write and perform with 
some of the industries best. <br/><br/>

Elias is one of Sweden's most interesting and anticipated young artists 2015. It takes just three seconds for 
Elias’s debut single “Revolution” to leave an indelible impression. That voice emerges from out of the ether: 
tender  yet possessing an evident power, it builds into a powerful  crescendo which exudes the passion of 
soul. It’s a vocal you’d expect from someone whose talents had been seasoned by decades of performance 
and heartache.<br/><br/>

Yet a second surprise is soon forthcoming, for Elias is just 18­years­old.
Thematically it’s a classic protest song. “Revolution is about the beauty of breaking up something you don’t 
believe in and instead doing something the way that you want to,” he explains. “It’s not an angry song, it’s 
more about the excitement of being able to make a brand new start.”<br/><br/>

It’s a track that only represents one side of Elias’s sounds. Otis Redding is an obvious inspiration, but he 
also credits FKA twigs, Spooky Black and Patti Smith as artists that he admires “for making his own way.” 
His other songs could be bolder in scale or far more intimate; they could be built around live instrumentation 
or structured on electronic sounds: “I don’t want my music to be limited by any rules.”
